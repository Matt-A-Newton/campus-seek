        </div>
        <div>
            <p>By using a modern take on the classic game "Hide and Seek". Scattered around campus there are fliers with QR codes. Each flier is labeled with a number to denote which flier it is. Can you find them all?</p>
            <p style="font-size: calc(0.7rem + 0.2vw)">Hint: The first one is in the Building for Academic and Student Services (BASS)! Tell others which fliers you've found on Twitter ("X") and other Social Media using the hastag "#campus_seek"!</p>
